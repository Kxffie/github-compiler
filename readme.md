# Kxffie's Github Compiler

please make an issue request if there is a problem, this was made for and on a windows system so it may or may not work for linux/mac.
you can make a PR to make it work for the 2 if youd like, im not going to since most users who need help with compiling are using windows.

it should compile the github repository autoamtically if you have Java installed
but the auto installer is pretty janky and doesnt work 100% of the time

# INSTRUCTIONS

download the RUNME.bat, run it, it installed the necessary requirements
download the main.exe and run it
input the github link
done!
